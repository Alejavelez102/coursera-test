### welcome to GitHub Pages
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects . Author your page content here [using GitHub Flovored Markdown](https://guides.github.com.co/feadtures/mastering.markdown/), slect a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check  out the new 'gh-pages' branch locally. If you're using GiHub Deesktop, simply sync your repositoryand you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to ue. Go.ahead and  click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through  then , you can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page , you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your page content will be preserved.

### Creating Pages manually 
If you prefer to not use the automatic generate, push a branch need ´gh.pages´ to  you repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll,  a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers  and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating feactures.

###Authors and Contributors 
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting ´<a>´ element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrash (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
